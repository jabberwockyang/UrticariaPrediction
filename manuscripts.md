- **Definition and Prevalence**:
    
    - Urticaria is a common condition presenting with wheals, angioedema, or both, driven by mast cell degranulation[1](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-1) [2](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-2) [4](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-4) [6](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-6).
    - The lifetime prevalence for acute urticaria is approximately 20%[1](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-1) [4](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-4) [6](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-6).
- **Classification**:
    
    - Urticaria is classified based on duration and triggers:
        - **Acute Urticaria**: Lasts less than 6 weeks, often triggered by specific causes like drugs, food, or infections[5](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-5) [6](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-6) [7](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-7).
        - **Chronic Urticaria**: Lasts more than 6 weeks and includes:
            - **Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU)**: No specific external trigger identified, often associated with autoimmune mechanisms[2](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-2) [6](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-6) [7](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-7).
            - **Chronic Inducible Urticaria (CIndU)**: Triggered by physical stimuli such as pressure, temperature changes, or exercise[2](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-2) [5](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-5) [7](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-7).

- **Pathogenesis**:
    
    - Urticaria involves complex pathomechanisms, including immunological and non-immunological mast cell activation[2](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-2) [7](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-7) [8](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-8).
    - Autoantibodies to mast cell receptors are found in nearly half of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, indicating an autoimmune component[10](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-10).
- **Significance and Impact**:
    
    - Chronic urticaria significantly impairs quality of life, affecting work and school performance[1](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-1) [4](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-4) [6](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-6).
    - It is considered a severe allergic disease due to its disabling nature and high disease burden[1](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-1) [4](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-4) [6](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-6).
- **Management**:
    
    - Current guidelines recommend non-sedating antihistamines and omalizumab, an anti-IgE antibody, for chronic urticaria due to their efficacy and safety profiles[2](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-2).
    - Diagnostic approaches and therapeutic strategies are evidence-based and tailored to the specific subtype of urticaria[1](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-1) [4](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-4) [6](https://consensus.app/results/?q=what%20is%20urticaria%20its%20classification%20and%20its%20significance&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-6).

Higher age at onset, female gender, long disease duration, and aspirin/NSAID hypersensitivity are linked to severe CSU and longer time to remission[1](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Why%20is%20predicting%20duration%20of%20urticaria%20being%20a%20need&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-1) [3](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Why%20is%20predicting%20duration%20of%20urticaria%20being%20a%20need&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-3). 

In children, age, clinical presentations, coexistent pyrexia or angioedema, and personal histories of allergic diseases, especially atopic dermatitis, are significant predictors of the duration of acute urticaria[2](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Why%20is%20predicting%20duration%20of%20urticaria%20being%20a%20need&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-2). 
Concomitant inducible urticaria and recurrent angioedema are associated with longer CSU duration[1](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Why%20is%20predicting%20duration%20of%20urticaria%20being%20a%20need&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-1) [7](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Why%20is%20predicting%20duration%20of%20urticaria%20being%20a%20need&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-7). 

Patients with multiple allergic diseases tend to have longer durations of urticaria[2](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Why%20is%20predicting%20duration%20of%20urticaria%20being%20a%20need&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-2).
Positive autologous serum skin test (ASST), basophil numbers, inflammatory markers, markers of activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, immunoglobulin E, and vitamin D levels are potential biomarkers for CSU severity and duration[1](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Why%20is%20predicting%20duration%20of%20urticaria%20being%20a%20need&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-1) [3](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Why%20is%20predicting%20duration%20of%20urticaria%20being%20a%20need&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-3).Plasma levels of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein may function as markers of CSU severity[3](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Why%20is%20predicting%20duration%20of%20urticaria%20being%20a%20need&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-3). Serum diamine oxidase (DAO) levels are associated with the response to antihistamines and dietary interventions, indicating a potential role in predicting disease duration[5](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Why%20is%20predicting%20duration%20of%20urticaria%20being%20a%20need&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-5).
High waist circumference (WC) rather than high body mass index (BMI) is a predictive risk factor for longer disease duration of CSU[4](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Why%20is%20predicting%20duration%20of%20urticaria%20being%20a%20need&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-4).

Predicting the duration of urticaria, particularly chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), is crucial for effective patient management and treatment planning. 
Duration of CSU greater than 3 years and specific biomarkers (e.g., DAO levels) are associated with better responses to second-generation antihistamines and other treatments[5](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Why%20is%20predicting%20duration%20of%20urticaria%20being%20a%20need&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en#result-5).
several studies have been conducted to predict the diseast duration of various diseases, such as chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic heart failure. However, few studies have focused on predicting the disease duration of urticaria.
The aim of this study was to build a machine learning model for predicting the disease duration of urticaria based on clinical laboratory data and to identify the factors affecting the disease duration of chronic urticaria by analyzing the importance of variables in the model, hoping to provide a reference for the clinical management of urticaria.



# methods and materials
## patients and data acquisition
patients with urticaria were recruited from the dermatology department of the first affiliated hospital of zhejiang university from january 2010 to december 2020. the inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients diagnosed with urticaria according to the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of urticaria; (2) patients with complete clinical data; (3) patients who signed informed consent forms. the exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with other skin diseases; (2) patients with severe systemic diseases; (3) patients with incomplete clinical data. the study was approved by the ethics committee of the first affiliated hospital of zhejiang university. the data of patients with urticaria were collected from the electronic medical record system of the hospital, including demographic data, clinical data, laboratory data, and follow-up data. the data were stored in a mysql database for subsequent analysis.


## statistical methods
## database building

mysql relationshp database was build for management and query of patient data, visit data and examination data. patient data is identified by primary key patient_id, with foreign key in visit table and examination table. visit data is identified by primary key visit_id, with foreign key in examination table. examination data is identified by primary key examination_id, with foreign key in visit table. the database schema is shown in dbml in supplementary material

### feature engineering
visit duration, the time interval between the first and last visit, was used as the target variable for the prediction model.
2 types of feature engineering are used. one is average value of each feature for each patient, the other is time series feature for each patient. In time series engineering, feature of each patient is extracted from period before first visit (preclinical), period within 42 days after the first visit (acute), and period after 42 days of the first visit. the data query sql is shown in supplementary material


## hyperparameter optimization and evaluation of different models performance
dataset is divided in a 7:3 ratio the 7 parts for training and validation the 3 parts for testing model performance.
rf, xgboost, adaboost, gbm, svm were used for model training
hyperparameter optimization was performed using TPE algorithm by nni package in python, which is a bayesian optimization algorithm that uses tree-structured parzen estimator to model the objective function and suggest the next set of hyperparameters to evaluate based on the previous results.
Internal 5 fold cross-validation was employed to discern the most suitable hyperparameters for each distinct model, individually applied to each model for enhanced precision
auc for different duration cuttoff (42, 100, 365) is measured for selecting best model for predicting disease duration of urticaria

## feature selection
boruta algorithm is used for feature selection. confirmed variables ranked by importance given by boruta allgorithm were further used for model optimization. by adopting different topn, the model performance is compared to find the best feature selection strategy.

## analysis of variables importance across different age group

shapley value is used to measure the importance of variables in the model
since age seems to play major affect 
model training on seperating age group data are further adopted to see various variables importance across different age group, kde plot of value distribution across different outcome group is used for validation of the indication of variable importance results for clinical use.
